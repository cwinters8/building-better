An opinionated course on getting started building for the web with Go.

**All you need to get started is a web browser and a working knowledge of how to navigate the internet.**

## Goals

⭐️ To empower others to start building toward a better, [less bloated](#web-bloat), web.

Through this beginner-friendly course, I hope to start taking a step in a better direction - one that will allow more users worldwide to utilize and enjoy the rich resources that the internet has created and will continue to create.

To do that, I think more people need to know how to build a performant, modern, data-driven website.

I personally think the ideal, and least complex, way to begin on this path is to start with HTML and Go. We will be touching on some other technologies, such as [JavaScript](#javascript), CSS, and databases, but they are not the main focus of this course.

## What isn't included

There are some things we will not go over in detail, because there are plenty of excellent resources on these topics already. However, I am open to expanding this resource if others are interested in contributing.

<!-- need to replace list with a table here, representing topics and sources -->

- data structures and algorithms
- scaling for production
- cloud services
- probably countless other details

## Intentions

This course will be continuously evolving as needed, and is considered to be a work in progress at the time of this writing. Both technology and understanding are constantly changing, and so this course will be continuously evolving. It is considered to be a work in progress at the time of this writing, with no current (or future) guarantees of being "correct" in all ways.

## Philosophy

Simple is better than complex for most cases.

[Perfection is the enemy of good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good).

## Incomplete glossary

### Web bloat

The [web has become bloated](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/fix-javascript-bloat).

And it definitely matters.

> ...there are plenty of sites that will use 10MB or 20MB of data. If you’re reading this from the U.S., maybe you don’t care, but if you’re browsing from Mauritania, Madagascar, or Vanuatu, loading codinghorror once will cost you more than 10% of the daily per capita GNI.

### JavaScript

To be used minimally and carefully. The website should be functional and easy on the eyes **even without JavaScript**. JavaScript was originally meant to be the sugar we sprinkle on top of an already good website to make it more fun and interactive.
